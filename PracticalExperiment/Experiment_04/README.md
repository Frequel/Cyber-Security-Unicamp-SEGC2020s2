# Computer Security EXP04 - Network analysis
The analysis of network traffic is critical in intrusion detection. Here is a file of network traffic in pcap format that corresponds to a real attack to a computer system, from beginning to end. Analyze the traffic file and answer the following questions:
1. Which are the involved systems (IP addresses)?
2. Where are geographically located the attacking hosts?
3. How many TCP sessions the traffic file contains?
4. How long did the attack last?
5. What were the actions taken during the attack (general outline of the steps)?
6. Was there any malicious code (malware) involved and, if so, what was the name of the malware, if identifyable by anti-malware mechanisms (like VirusTotal, for instance)?
